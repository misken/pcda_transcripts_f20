# What is the bash shell?

The bash shell is one of the primary ways that we will do work in our pcda virtual machine.

In this screencast I'll:

* show you multiple ways to open a bash shell in Linux
* give you an overview of the bash shell
* introduce the Software Carpentry tutorial on the bash shell

Let's start by seeing three ways to open a bash shell.

The first method is to use the keystroke combination CTRL-ALT-t.

Note that this will open a bash shell in your home directory.

The second method is to use the File Manager to browse to the
folder in which you want to open a bash shell, and press
the F4 key to open a bash shell with the working directory
already set to this folder.

Finally, you can press the blue Start button at the bottom left of 
the screen, select System Tools and then QTerminal.

## The bash shell

At a high level, computers:
Run programs
Store data
Communicate with other computers
Communicate with us

A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.
Command line interface (CLI), NOT a GUI
Main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio, its support for automating repetitive tasks, and that it can be used to access networked machines.
Main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how cryptic its commands and operation can be.

## Why learn the bash shell?

Many Linux tasks rely on you being competent with the shell
There are massive efficiency gains possible via the shell
GUI's not efficient at doing things like selecting or deleting hundreds of files with certain filenames
Simple “shell scripts” can automate running and rerunning some sequence of commands (analogous to Excel macros)
Seriously, try deleting 5000 files from a Windows folder
Using the shell gets you “closer” to the computer and increases your understanding of what computing is all about
Reinforces notion of functional decomposition
Separate little programs that do one thing and do it well
Make these little programs work together to do more complex things
Real nerds know how to use a Linux command shell

## Getting ready

We are going to use a combination of material from Software Carpentry and one of my research projects
Let's get the Downloads file downloaded on the virtual machine into ~/Downloads folder
Copy it to the ~/Documents folder and extract it
Now let's visit the Software Carpentry site and its bash tutorial - http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/
Good vignette on need for shell skills and then lessons on shell basics
I highly encourage you to go through this on your own after our intro tonight. Just go through sections up through Pipes and Filters
data for this tutorial available from page at link above as well as in Downloads folder in shell-data.zip
links to additional Linux and shell tutorials are available in Moodle

Software Carpentry is a site dedicated to helping scientists become better programmers. They
have a number of very good tutorials that are relevant to our course. You can find them in
the Lessons section of their website. I encourage you to use these as additional learning
resources for our course.
