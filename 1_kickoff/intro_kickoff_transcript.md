Kickoff - transcript (9:09)
===========================

Welcome to Week 1 of our Practical Computing for Data Analytics (PCDA) class. We’ll do several things the first week of class:

    * Get an overview of the field of business analytics / data science
    * Review course logistics
    * get some hands on experience with some of the technology we’ll use in the course
    
I want everyone to get a very good sense of the kinds of things we'll
be learning and doing in this course.

Since this is our first week, this welcome video will be a little longer
than they will be in subsequent weeks.

Start by going to the "Week 1 Guide" page
by following this link in Moodle.

This will give you a high level look at the upcoming week in terms
of which page we'll be using in the public courseweb and an overview
of any prep problems, homework assignments and quizzes that are 
assigned this week.

Notice that there is a link at the top of the Week 1 overview page
to the content for the week.  Below that you can see that there is
a new Prep Problem assigned as well as the first weekly Quiz.

Week 1 Objectives and course content
------------------------------------

Let's go to the "Intro to pcda" page and review the structure of a
typical content page. Each week of the course will, in general, have
its own page.

Each content page has several main sections: Intro and objectives, Readings,
Downloads, Activities and Explore.

Give the week's wage an overall read through to get a sense of 
what's on tap for the week. 

### Objectives

Read through the objectives.

### Readings

Check out the Readings section. I'll usually give an overview of
the role of the readings, which things are must-reads and which
are more of related reference readings.

### Downloads

Get the Downloads file(s) downloaded and extracted in the location of
your choosing on the pcda vm (and anywhere else you'd like). I'll
download this week's file. Make sure you click Download and then
Save file - NOT open with Archive Manager! - and the file will automatically get downloaded to your
Downloads folder. 

I'm going to move the downloaded file from Downloads to my Documents/sessions
directory. Now, I'll right click the file and select Extract here...

The file will get extracted as a folder with the same name as the Downloads file.

Browse into that folder and you'll find some files and subfolders. We'll be
using these during the week's activities.

### Activities

This is where I'll guide us through the various learning activities for
the week. For most activities, there will be an associated screencast
and most will have transcripts. I break things up into smallish, logical
chunks and give a little description for each chunk.

Some activities will be labelled as optional. They are optional. Depending
on your interest and time, you might choose to look at these items now
or after the semester. Some of these are more advanced or specialized topics.
Depending on what you do for your final project, you may find some of these
to be quite useful. However, **Quizzes and Homework assignments will never
be based on optional content**.

### Explore

These are optional things that you might choose to explore.

Week 1 Assignments
------------------------------------

Let's go back to the Moodle and Week 1 Guide. You'll see there is
a listing of any assignments for the week. The first Prep Problem is
assigned this week and there's always a weekly Quiz. I'll usually
include a little info about each item. However, the links for the
items themselves are back on the main Moodle page and I'll often
include more detail and even "Getting Started" screencasts there.

Let's go back to the main Moodle page and I'll click on the link
for Prep Problem 1. Prep Problems are meant as short exercises to 
help prepare you for upcoming activities and assignments. As it says
here, they are not graded in detail and you'll get full credit as long
as you make a good effort. 

Sometimes any files you need will be available directly from the
assignment itself, but in this as it details here, you can find the
file, PP1_IntroToPCDA.md, inside the Downloads for Week 1. Let's
go take a look and confirm for ourself. 

Yep, here is is. It's just a plain text file in what is known as
*markdown* format. We'll be using markdown heavily throughout this
course and you'll become very familiar with it very quickly. Since it's
plain text, I'll just open it in Geany (one of the text editors installed
on our pcda VM) by right clicking the file and selecting Geany.

Well, what do you know! Looks like I created a short screencast that
helps you get started with this Prep Problem. You'll see that this
problem involves becoming familiar with using Lubuntu Linix and our
pcda virtual machine. In the second part of the problem you have to
figure out how to do screenshot, save the file with a specific
filename, and upload it to Moodle using the Prep Problem 1 upload link.

**Before** you start this Prep Problem, you should first go through the weekly
activities available on the Intro to PCDA courseweb page.

Well, we are off and running for Week 1.

Remember, if you have questions about something, don't immediately 
email me. Instead, post a question in the course Q&A Forum.
