pcda class overview - transcript ()
=====================================

Welcome to the first week of our Practical Computing for Data Analytics (PCDA) class. We’ll do several things the first week of class:

    * Get an overview of the field of business analytics / data science
    * Review course logistics
    * get some hands on experience with some of the technology we’ll use in the course
    
I want everyone to get a very good sense of the kinds of things we'll
be learning and doing in this course.

Let's use the Week 1 Guide to navigate to this week's session on our pdca courseweb.

As outlined in the [Intro to Week 1 video](), make sure you've got
this week's Downloads file downloaded and extracted in a location
of your choosing. I'm going to redownload it now and put the
extracted folder into my Documents folder.

Let's see what's inside this folder.

Notice that there are some slides for this week in two different formats.

The kickoff_slides.ipynb file is a Jupyter notebook, and even though
we won't be using Jupyter until later in the semester when we are
learning Python, I was experimenting with creating slides using
Jupyter and so I thought I'd do that for this week just to preview some of the magic
of Jupyter notebooks. I've also
made an html version of the slides available that you can view
in any browser. 

If you want to get a little early experience with using Jupyter
notebooks, then feel free to follow along as I launch and use the
slides as a Jupyter notebook. If not, just open the html version.

Notice also that there is a folder named `peek_r_python` that 
contains a bunch of files that we'll use later in this session. I want
to actually give you a chance this very first week to get a hands-on
priview of the main tools we'll be using this semester - R, R Studio,
Python, and Jupyter notebooks.

Finally, you'll see that there's a file named `PP1_IntroToPCDA.md`. 
This is a text file written with markdown that you'll be using
in the first Prep Problem - which is one of the Assignments for this week.

Launching the kickoff slides
----------------------------

This is **totally optional** for you since you can just open the html
version of the slides in a browswer. In fact I'll do that first.

Now, I'm going to open a bash shell by making sure my File Manager is in
the folder containing the Jupyter notebook version of the slides and
pressing the F4 key. We'll be learning all about the bash shell
next week so don't worry.

At the bash prompt I'll type:

	$ conda activate datasci
	
This will activate the specific Python virtual environment we'll be using
in this class.

Then, to launch Jupyter:

	$ jupyter notebook
	
Notice it will launch in your browser and I'll select the `kickoff_slides.ipynb`
file to open it. We'll talk a little more about Jupyter notebooks later
in this session, but for now, I'm just going to click this little
icon in the toolbar to launch the slideshow.

Voila! 

Outline
-------

This week we'll be doing the following:

* We'll get a brief overview of the field of business analytics and data science
* I'll give you an overview of the kinds of things we'll be doing and the tools we'll be using
* We'll get our first chance to start to learn to use the pcda virtual machine
	- we'll do a basic tour of the pcda VM
	- we'll do a preview of both R and Python
* I'll give you some guidance on the things you should be doing next
