Syllabus and course website review
==================================

Please login to the course Moodle site.

At the top you'll find general course information as well as this link
to "Our pcda courseweb". Let's get that open in another browser window.

Directly below that link you'll find links to some of my other
homes on the web:

* My OU webpage - contains info about me and my work. Includes links to other courses I teach.
* My GitHub page - you should create a free GitHub account as we'll be learning version control with git and GitHub
* My hselab.org page - this is where I do technical blogging about analytics and related topics

Below these links you'll find several items.

You should have already watched the course welcome video.

By now you should have already reviewed the syllabus. It's a Google
doc and I just want to comment on a few items.

Syllabus
--------

I'm going to jump to the All Things Tech section.

It's important to realize that this is going to be a very challenging
and technical course. Almost everything we do is going to be
programmatic in nature. It will be very different than working
with point and click software such as MS Excel. A big part of 
becoming a more computationally savvy analyst is developing the mindset and 
skills to be able to learn how to read, write, and debug analytics
related programs. You will make a ton of mistakes. The sooner that you
embrace the reality that in almost every single case, the mistake is
due to something you did. Don't blame the computer. Don't blame the
software. Don't blame me. You broke it, you fix it. :)

I will spend a significant amount of time helping you learn to troubleshoot
broken code or sketchy analyses. You'll get good at using sites
like StackOverflow and you'll get good at asking technical questions
in an appropriate way. The open source community is very helpful,
but, you have to show that you've made the effort to fix your own
problems before asking someone else to spend their time helping
you fix them. 

This mindset and these skills will pay off in the professional world.

Now let's jump to the Assignments and Grading section.

You'll notice there are no exams - I've never had exams in this course
nor in my spreadsheet based Business Analytics course.

There will be 4-5 Homework Assignments that make up 50% of the grade.

There are short weekly online quizzes that hit the major concepts and
help you keep up in the course.

Prep Problems are short assignments that help you prepare for upcoming
sessions and upcoming assignments. They are NOT graded in detail. Just
give them a good effort and you'll get full credit. 

Finally, there's a Final Project that allows you to explore something
that you are interested in learning more about. There's a Final
Project section in our Moodle site that has all the details and links
to a bunch of projects done in previous semesters so that you can get
a sense of what is possible.

Please read the Grading Philosophy and check your grading anxiety 
at the door. I'm assuming that by choosing to take this class you
sincerely want to learn how to use tools like R and Python to do
computationally oriented data analytics. This is hard stuff and
I grade accordingly. I want you to be focused on learning, not
on grades.

Make sure you read through ALL of the syllabus carefully.

Next is the link to info about the textbooks and the pcda virtual
machine. You should have already gone through this material on your own.

Forums
------

There are three distinct Forums.

Announcements - Only I post in here and these will be informational items for the whole class

General Q & A Forum - As it says in the instructions for the Forum, use this
to post questions about things in the course as opposed to sending me email. We
will all help each other learn in this course. It's important to post well
thought out questions, with specific subject lines and information about what
you have already tried to do to solve your own problem. We'll be talking
and reading more about how to appropriately ask questions on these
kinds of technical forums.

Participant Lounge - this is the forum to post introductions, and 
other things that might only be tangentially related to the course.

Weekly Topic
------------

Now let's look at this week's Moodle topic to see how the topics
are structured and how to use the public course web to access
the actual content for the week.

Each week starts with a Welcome Video for the week. In this I'll
give you a short overview of the week's topic or pass on any
relevant information for the week.

Next, each week will have a Weekly Guide page. Let's check it out.

The Weekly Guide starts by directing you to the pcda courseweb and
lists out the standard things to do once you get there. Let's
go there now and you'll see that the pcda courseweb is where you'll be
spending the bulk of your time.

pcda courseweb
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I would by now that you've already spent some time exploring the
pcda courseweb. You'll notice that it's got navigation built in,
with buttons for going to the next or previous topics as well as
to subtopics within a page. You can go to the main Table of
Contents by clicking the Table of Contents link or the pcda courseweb
link in the upper left corner of the screen.

From the main Table of Contents you can see that the pcda courseweb
is broken up into a few main parts:

* Course logistics and resources
* Getting started with pcda and Linux (Weeks 1 and 2)
* Intro to data analytics with R (Weeks 3-8)
* Intro to data analytics with Python (Weeks 9-14)

Let's go back to this week's page, Intro to PCDA Course.
