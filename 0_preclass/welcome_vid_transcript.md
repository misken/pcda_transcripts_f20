General welcome
---------------

Hi everyone. Welcome to Practical Computing for Data Analytics for
the Fall 2020 semester. My name is Mark Isken and I'll be the
instructor for this course. I created this course back in 2014
because I wanted students at OU to get an introduction to a
different, more computational and open source based, approach to doing analytics work. 

The course is usually held in the 202 Elliott Hall teaching lab and
draws a wide range of undergraduate and graduate students from
within and outside of the School of Business. Obviously, this year,
due to the Covid-19 pandemic, I'm offering the course online.

The nature of the course and how I teach it actually lends itself
quite well to online delivery. Over the past few years I've created
a number of screencasts that I make available to students even
though the class was taught in a lab. Students could review the
screencasts at their own speed or could use them as a substitute for
class attendance if they needed to travel for work. As you'll see,
becoming comfortable with this new way of doing analytics work 
requires you to do a lot of hands on work using the R Markdown
and Jupyter notebooks that I provide. You'll see that self-learning
with these tools is very doable and you'll also have my screencasts
and other resources that provide the same level of guidance and help that I provide when
doing it live in class.

What to do before class starts
------------------------------

There are several things you should do before the class gets started.

### Review syllabus

Start by reviewing the syllabus carefully. It's a Google Doc and you
need to be authenticated with your OU email login to access it. I
think it's important that you have a very good idea of what this course
will be like before committing to taking it.

### Become familiar with the course websites

Next, I want you to become familiar with the course websites. We'll
be using Moodle as well as a publicly accessible course website that
I've built which houses the main course content. I'll talk more about
this in the first session, but for now, browse through the course Moodle
site and then you can use this link near the top of the Moodle page
labelled "pdca courseweb" to access the public courseweb. You'll see
that it's got built in navigation and you can browse through the various
sessions to get a sense of what we'll be doing in the course and how
the course website is structured.

### Review course logistics sections

Finally, you'll see that there's a link in Moodle to the
"Course logistics, textbooks, software, resources" page. This link
will take you back out to the public website to a section that
covers important details such as the textbooks and software used in the course.

Speaking of software, this is by far the most important thing you
need to do before the first week of class. From the Course Logistics
page, navigate to the "Software and pcda virtual machine".

Give this page a thorough read before trying to do anything regarding
getting the pcda VM working on your computer. But, yes, before the
first week of class, you should get the pcda VM installed on your
computer. There is a ton of information, both written and video, that
I've created to help you do this. Every single student who has taken
this course over the past six years has gotten the VM working on
their computer. So will you. I'll be sending out a Forum Post with
additional information and encouragement, a few weeks before the 
class starts. I may have already done that by the time you are
reading this. When you get the pcda VM working on your computer,
I'd like you to respond to my post in the "Course Questions and Answers Forum"
just saying that you got it installed and include any info you
think might be helpful to other students. Software is continually changing
and there are almost always unforseen issues. We will all help each
other succeed in this course - and that's especially relevant for
getting technology working.

## Closing thoughts

I'm super happy to have you all in my course and I promise that you will
learn a ton of useful things that will help you further your 
analytical skills and your career.
